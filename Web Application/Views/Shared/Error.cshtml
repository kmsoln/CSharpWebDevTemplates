<!--
    Error.cshtml

    This Razor view is used to display error information when an unhandled exception occurs
    during the processing of a user's request. It is typically rendered when the application
    is in the production environment.

    Model:
    - The model for this view is an ErrorViewModel, which contains information about the error,
      including an optional RequestId.

    View Components:
    - The view includes headings, paragraphs, and conditional rendering based on the presence of a RequestId.

    Development Mode:
    - Provides information about the Development environment, advising against enabling it for deployed applications.
      Enabling Development mode can expose sensitive information to end users.

    Usage:
    - This view is automatically displayed when an unhandled exception occurs. It is associated with the
      ErrorController in the ASP.NET Core application.

    Note:
    - Customize the content and appearance of this view based on the specific needs and security considerations
      of your application.
