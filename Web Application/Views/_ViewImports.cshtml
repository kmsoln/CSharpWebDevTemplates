    _ViewImports.cshtml

    This file is a Razor view imports file in an ASP.NET Core application. 
    It plays a crucial role in configuring shared directives and tag helpers 
    that are applicable to multiple views within the same directory and its subdirectories.

    Razor view imports files are automatically executed before the rendering 
    of any view, making them an ideal place to define common imports, tag helpers, 
    and other directives that should be consistently applied across multiple views.

    Key components in this file:

    1. Namespace Imports:
       - The '@using' directives declare namespaces that are available to all views 
         in the specified scope, eliminating the need to duplicate them in every view.
    
    2. Tag Helper Import:
       - The '@addTagHelper' directive specifies the tag helpers that should be 
         applied globally. Tag helpers enhance the functionality of HTML elements 
         and are commonly used for generating dynamic content and performing 
         server-side logic within views.

    It is essential to maintain and update this file to ensure a uniform and 
    standardized configuration for views, promoting consistency and ease of maintenance.

    Note: Avoid cluttering this file with unnecessary directives to keep it focused 
    on the essentials needed for the views in its scope.
