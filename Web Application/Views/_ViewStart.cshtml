    _ViewStart.cshtml

    This file is a Razor view start file in an ASP.NET Core application. 
    It allows you to define common settings that are applied to all views 
    in the same directory and its subdirectories.

    The primary purpose of _ViewStart.cshtml is to set the default layout 
    for views, but it can also include other common configurations for views.

    Key components in this file:

    1. Layout Setting:
       - The '@{ Layout = "_Layout"; }' code sets the default layout page 
         for all views in the specified scope. This layout will be used 
         unless overridden by an individual view.
         
Example Usage:

    - Setting a Different Layout:
      To use a different layout for all views in a specific folder and its 
      subfolders, you can change the value assigned to 'Layout':

      @{
          Layout = "_AlternateLayout";
      }

    - Applying Global Configuration:
      You can use this file to apply global configurations, such as setting 
      ViewBag properties or ViewBag.Title, which will be available to all views.

      @{
          ViewBag.Title = "My Global Title";
      }

    It is essential to manage this file carefully, as changes made here 
    can impact the layout and behavior of multiple views.

    Note: Avoid including complex logic in this file, as its main purpose 
    is to establish common settings for views.
